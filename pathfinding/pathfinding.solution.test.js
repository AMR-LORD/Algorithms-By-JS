**Task 1:** Define a function named `findShortestPathLength` that takes three parameters:
- A 2D array `maze` representing the grid.
- Two coordinate pairs `[xA, yA]` and `[xB, yB]` representing the starting and ending points.

---

**Task 2:** Create a `visited` matrix based on the `maze`:
- For each cell in the `maze`, initialize an object with the following properties:
  - `closed`: Set to `true` if the corresponding cell in the `maze` is blocked (e.g., value `1`), otherwise `false`.
  - `length`: Initialize to `0`.
  - `openedBy`: Initialize to `NO_ONE` (indicating no one has visited this cell yet).
  - `x` and `y`: Store the coordinates of the cell.

---

**Task 3:** Mark the starting and ending points:
- Set the `openedBy` property of the starting point `[xA, yA]` to `BY_A`.
- Set the `openedBy` property of the ending point `[xB, yB]` to `BY_B`.

---

**Task 4:** Log the initial state of the `visited` matrix for debugging purposes.

---

**Task 5:** Initialize two queues:
- Add the starting point `[xA, yA]` to the `aQueue`.
- Add the ending point `[xB, yB]` to the `bQueue`.

---

**Task 6:** Initialize a variable `iteration` to `0` to track the number of steps taken.

---

**Task 7:** Start a loop that continues as long as both `aQueue` and `bQueue` are not empty:
- Increment the `iteration` counter by `1`.

---

**Task 8:** Process the neighbors of all cells in `aQueue`:
- For each cell in `aQueue`, find its valid neighbors using the `getNeighbors` function:
  - Valid neighbors are those that are not blocked (`closed === false`) and have not been visited yet.
- For each neighbor:
  - If the neighbor was opened by `BY_B`, return the sum of its `length` and the current `iteration` as the shortest path length.
  - Otherwise, if the neighbor has not been visited (`openedBy === NO_ONE`):
    - Set its `length` to the current `iteration`.
    - Set its `openedBy` to `BY_A`.
    - Add it to the `aQueue`.

---

**Task 9:** Process the neighbors of all cells in `bQueue`:
- For each cell in `bQueue`, find its valid neighbors using the `getNeighbors` function:
  - Valid neighbors are those that are not blocked (`closed === false`) and have not been visited yet.
- For each neighbor:
  - If the neighbor was opened by `BY_A`, return the sum of its `length` and the current `iteration` as the shortest path length.
  - Otherwise, if the neighbor has not been visited (`openedBy === NO_ONE`):
    - Set its `length` to the current `iteration`.
    - Set its `openedBy` to `BY_B`.
    - Add it to the `bQueue`.

---

**Task 10:** Log the updated state of the `visited` matrix for debugging purposes.

---

**Task 11:** If the loop ends without finding a connection between the two queues, return `-1` to indicate that there is no valid path.

---

**Task 12:** Define a helper function `getNeighbors` to find valid neighbors of a given cell:
- Check the four possible directions (up, down, left, right) from the current cell:
  - Ensure the neighboring cell is within the bounds of the `maze`.
  - Ensure the neighboring cell is not blocked (`closed === false`).
- Return a list of all valid neighbors.

--- 

This step-by-step breakdown explains the logic and flow of the algorithm without using any code.
