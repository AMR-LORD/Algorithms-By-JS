**Task 1:** Define a function named `findShortestPathLength` that takes three parameters:
- A 2D array `maze` representing the grid.
- Two coordinate pairs `[xA, yA]` and `[xB, yB]` representing the starting and ending points.

---

**Task 2:** Create a `visited` matrix based on the `maze`:
- For each cell in the `maze`, initialize an object with the following properties:
  - `closed`: Set to `true` if the corresponding cell in the `maze` is blocked (e.g., value `1`), otherwise `false`.
  - `length`: Initialize to `0`.
  - `openedBy`: Initialize to `NO_ONE` (indicating no one has visited this cell yet).
  - `x` and `y`: Store the coordinates of the cell.

---

**Task 3:** Mark the starting and ending points:
- Set the `openedBy` property of the starting point `[xA, yA]` to `BY_A`.
- Set the `openedBy` property of the ending point `[xB, yB]` to `BY_B`.

---

**Task 4:** Log the initial state of the `visited` matrix for debugging purposes.

---

**Task 5:** Initialize two queues:
- Add the starting point `[xA, yA]` to the `aQueue`.
- Add the ending point `[xB, yB]` to the `bQueue`.

---

**Task 6:** Initialize a variable `iteration` to `0` to track the number of steps taken.

---

**Task 7:** Start a loop that continues as long as both `aQueue` and `bQueue` are not empty:
- Increment the `iteration` counter by `1`.

---

**Task 8:** Process the neighbors of all cells in `aQueue`:
- For each cell in `aQueue`, find its valid neighbors using the `getNeighbors` function:
  - Valid neighbors are those that are not blocked (`closed === false`) and have not been visited yet.
- For each neighbor:
  - If the neighbor was opened by `BY_B`, return the sum of its `length` and the current `iteration` as the shortest path length.
  - Otherwise, if the neighbor has not been visited (`openedBy === NO_ONE`):
    - Set its `length` to the current `iteration`.
    - Set its `openedBy` to `BY_A`.
    - Add it to the `aQueue`.

---

**Task 9:** Process the neighbors of all cells in `bQueue`:
- For each cell in `bQueue`, find its valid neighbors using the `getNeighbors` function:
  - Valid neighbors are those that are not blocked (`closed === false`) and have not been visited yet.
- For each neighbor:
  - If the neighbor was opened by `BY_A`, return the sum of its `length` and the current `iteration` as the shortest path length.
  - Otherwise, if the neighbor has not been visited (`openedBy === NO_ONE`):
    - Set its `length` to the current `iteration`.
    - Set its `openedBy` to `BY_B`.
    - Add it to the `bQueue`.

---

**Task 10:** Log the updated state of the `visited` matrix for debugging purposes.

---

**Task 11:** If the loop ends without finding a connection between the two queues, return `-1` to indicate that there is no valid path.

---

**Task 12:** Define a helper function `getNeighbors` to find valid neighbors of a given cell:
- Check the four possible directions (up, down, left, right) from the current cell:
  - Ensure the neighboring cell is within the bounds of the `maze`.
  - Ensure the neighboring cell is not blocked (`closed === false`).
- Return a list of all valid neighbors.

  /*
  Absolutely! I'll explain the same example in English for better clarity.

---

### **Practical Example:**

#### **1. The Maze (`maze`):**
Let's assume the maze looks like this:

```plaintext
[
  [0, 1, 0],  // First row
  [0, 0, 0],  // Second row
  [1, 0, 0]   // Third row
]
```

- First row `[0, 1, 0]` means:
  - Cell `(0, 0)` is open (`0`).
  - Cell `(0, 1)` is blocked (`1`).
  - Cell `(0, 2)` is open (`0`).

- Second row `[0, 0, 0]`: All cells are open.
- Third row `[1, 0, 0]`: Cell `(2, 0)` is blocked, and the rest are open.

---

#### **2. The `visited` Matrix:**
After executing the following code:

```javascript
const visited = maze.map((row, y) =>
  row.map((origin, x) => ({
    closed: origin === 1,
    length: 0,
    openedBy: NO_ONE,
    x,
    y
  }))
);
```

**Result:**  
The `visited` matrix will look like this:

```plaintext
[
  [
    { closed: false, length: 0, openedBy: NO_ONE, x: 0, y: 0 },  // Cell (0, 0)
    { closed: true,  length: 0, openedBy: NO_ONE, x: 1, y: 0 },  // Cell (0, 1)
    { closed: false, length: 0, openedBy: NO_ONE, x: 2, y: 0 }   // Cell (0, 2)
  ],
  [
    { closed: false, length: 0, openedBy: NO_ONE, x: 0, y: 1 },  // Cell (1, 0)
    { closed: false, length: 0, openedBy: NO_ONE, x: 1, y: 1 },  // Cell (1, 1)
    { closed: false, length: 0, openedBy: NO_ONE, x: 2, y: 1 }   // Cell (1, 2)
  ],
  [
    { closed: true,  length: 0, openedBy: NO_ONE, x: 0, y: 2 },  // Cell (2, 0)
    { closed: false, length: 0, openedBy: NO_ONE, x: 1, y: 2 },  // Cell (2, 1)
    { closed: false, length: 0, openedBy: NO_ONE, x: 2, y: 2 }   // Cell (2, 2)
  ]
]
```

---

#### **3. Marking Start and End Points:**
If the start point is `[xA, yA] = [0, 0]` and the end point is `[xB, yB] = [2, 2]`:

After executing the following code:

```javascript
visited[yA][xA].openedBy = BY_A; // Mark the start point as opened by BY_A
visited[yB][xB].openedBy = BY_B; // Mark the end point as opened by BY_B
```

**Result:**  
The `visited` matrix will now look like this:

```plaintext
[
  [
    { closed: false, length: 0, openedBy: BY_A, x: 0, y: 0 },  // Cell (0, 0) opened by BY_A
    { closed: true,  length: 0, openedBy: NO_ONE, x: 1, y: 0 },
    { closed: false, length: 0, openedBy: NO_ONE, x: 2, y: 0 }
  ],
  [
    { closed: false, length: 0, openedBy: NO_ONE, x: 0, y: 1 },
    { closed: false, length: 0, openedBy: NO_ONE, x: 1, y: 1 },
    { closed: false, length: 0, openedBy: NO_ONE, x: 2, y: 1 }
  ],
  [
    { closed: true,  length: 0, openedBy: NO_ONE, x: 0, y: 2 },
    { closed: false, length: 0, openedBy: NO_ONE, x: 1, y: 2 },
    { closed: false, length: 0, openedBy: BY_B, x: 2, y: 2 }   // Cell (2, 2) opened by BY_B
  ]
]
```

---

#### **4. Queues `aQueue` and `bQueue`:**
- **`aQueue`:**  
  Add the start point `[0, 0]` to the `aQueue`:

  ```javascript
  let aQueue = [visited[0][0]];
  ```

  **Final value of `aQueue`:**

  ```plaintext
  [
    { closed: false, length: 0, openedBy: BY_A, x: 0, y: 0 }
  ]
  ```

- **`bQueue`:**  
  Add the end point `[2, 2]` to the `bQueue`:

  ```javascript
  let bQueue = [visited[2][2]];
  ```

  **Final value of `bQueue`:**

  ```plaintext
  [
    { closed: false, length: 0, openedBy: BY_B, x: 2, y: 2 }
  ]
  ```
